## Project Description
This project was developed with the purpose to add new plants and keep all the data stored of the plants the user has seen. The main functions of this application are:

* Track all the data, and store it in a database.
* A wonderful compass to keep the user aware of the direction that he is going.
* A GPS location tracker to keep the user always aware of his position in the map.
* Camera function so the user can click wonderful pictures of the greenery.

## Programming language.
PhoneGap is a mobile development framework produced by Nitobi, purchased by Adobe Systems in 2011. It enables software programmers to build applications for mobile devices using JavaScript, HTML5, and CSS3, instead of relying on platform-specific APIs like those in iOS, Windows Phone, or Android. It enables wrapping up of HTML, CSS and Javascript code depending upon the platform of the device. It extends the features of HTML and Javascript to work with the device. The resulting applications are hybrid, meaning that they are neither truly native mobile application (because all layout rendering is done via web views instead of the platform's native UI framework) nor purely web-based (because they are not just web apps, but are packaged as apps for distribution and have access to native device APIs). From version 1.9 onward it is even possible to freely mix native and hybrid code snippets.

The software underlying PhoneGap is Apache Cordova. The software was previously called just "PhoneGap", then "Apache Callback". Apache Cordova is open source software so it allows non-Adobe wrappers around it such as Intel XDK or Appery.io.
